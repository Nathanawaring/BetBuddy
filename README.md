## Helper Scripts

* Two helper scripts are provided in this repository: [print_table.py](print_table.py) and [test_bet.py](test_bet.py)
* `print_table.py` prints tables in the database. It includes useful information such as game ID of completed games, games that users placed bets on, future games, etc...
* `test_bet.py` tests the bet functions to ensure it works properly. It takes in a parameter `<game ID>`, which will inject a bet of the corresponding game to the **first user** registered in the database.
* `test_bet.py` is useful when injecting a non-existent game ID to test if the system will detect it and remove it. Or injecting a completed game ID, test the reward system and remove the completed game from user's data table since it is no longer useful and relevant.
