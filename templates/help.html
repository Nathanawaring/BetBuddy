            <h2> A Guide To Sports Betting Odds </h2>
            <p> Not sure how betting odds work? This page will give you a clear understanding of how odds are calculated and used, with easy to follow explanations and examples. </p>

            <h2> What Do Betting Odds Mean And How Do They Impact The Payout? </h2>
            <p> Betting odds represents the possibility of a particular outcome. Sports betting odds indicate this same possibility within the results of sporting events. </p>
            <p> The odds on any particular event determines how much you can win based on your bet. The higher the the odds, the larger the payout. </p>

            <h2> How Betting Works On BetBuddy </h2>
            <p> There are many types of sports bets and many different things within the same event that could be bet on, but here at BetBuddy we focus on money line bets. </p>
            <p> Money line bets are wagers that are placed on a game's outcome. 
                On BetBuddy you are able to wager on the winner of upcoming NFL and NBA games.
                The outcomes are very simple, within the match of the two teams one will win and the other will lose.
                As for the sports bets placed, either the team selected will win and the bettor will receive a payout on the odds, or the team will lose and the unsuccessful bettor wins nothing in return. </p>
                <p> Odds are just numbers that represent the payouts for these sports events and are based on team matchups. 
                    Bookmakers separate team matchups based on who's the favorites to win and who's the underdogs. 
                    Lower (-) odds are given to the team that is considered more likely to win (the favorite) and higher (+) odds are given to the team considered more likely to lose (the underdog). </p>
            <p> Some events, such as fights, may have a third possible bet option: a draw. But for the moment BetBuddy limits sports bets to NFL and NBA games. </p>

            <h2> How To Read Betting Odds </h2>
            <h3> How Does The "+" And "-" Determine The Payout? </h3>
            <p> In American sports betting, odds are typically expressed with a plus (+) or minus (-) symbol followed by a number. These represent high and low odds respectfully.
                The number associated with negative odds is how much you need to wager to win $100, whereas the number associated with positive odds is how much you win with a successful $100 wager. 
                In short, a -500 odd would allow for a $500 bet to win $100, while a +500 odd would allow for a $100 bet to win $500. The lower odd sounds like a much better investment but this is due to it's much lower chance of success. 
                As in this example, you have the possibility to win $500 but you are much more likely to lose $100. </p>
            <p> Don't worry, this translates the same to smaller odds. For example, </p>
            <p> - Higher Odds (e.x. +500): For every $1 you bet, you can win $5 if the bet is successful, resulting in a larger payout. </p>
            <p> - Lower Odds (e.x. -500): Betting $5 will win you $1, this smaller payout that results is what comes with a higher chance of success. </p>
